These are the configuration files for my Arch/dwm set-up. I am running this on two laptops: Lenovo ThinkPad X1 carbon (my notes on installing Arch on it [here](https://tonymugen.github.io/ArchLinuxThinkPadX1C4gen.html)) and System76 Oryx Pro 2018 with a 4K display (and a second 4K monitor most of the time; Arch installation instructions [here](https://tonymugen.github.io/ArchLinuxSys76OP.html)).

This is a bare repository, I am maintaining it using [these instructions](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles). The Oryx Pro is my main machine, so these files may have some things that work only on it. I maintain the ThinkPad branch for the ThinkPad.
